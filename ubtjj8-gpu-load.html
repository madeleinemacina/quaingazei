So i mentioned that my gpu load is 100% started to read forums here and nothing helped. Then i played with radeon settings maybe and something really. It's absolutely ridiculous that the GPU load is 100% in idle mode, aka while in port, with maximum power consumption while the GPU load in battle is 50%-60%. It's like you stand at a red traffic light at full throttle and when you can drive you switch  Двухпроцессорные стоечные серверы 2U корпоративного класса на базе процессоров Intel Xeon E5-2600. 
i saw idle and gaming(or gpu) load consumption  what is that? example gtx660:) is gaming load overlocked gpu power consumption? or when ultra settings.

Im playing it stretched(1079x1080) and i am experiencing some really hard lag issues. My GPU load is runniing in Tilted Towers with 40% and im having 100 FPS, which is not that good, because i have a 144 Hz Monitor.

So I just finished running a benchmark on 3D Mark, I exit out after and notice that my GPU temps were high for being Idle and my clock is at max, I then check on GPU-Z and MSI Afterburner and my load is stuck at 100% even though I’m idling??

Hi, I have an issue that seems to be driver related but not everybody has it on their reference model rx 480. One out of three times when I boot the gpu load sits at 100% even when idle, keeping the temp to 80° and consumption to 80W instead of the usual 10-20. Linear regression probably is the most familiar technique of data analysis, but its application is often hamstrung by model assumptions. For instance, if the data has a hierarchical structure, quite often the assumptions of linear regression are feasible only at local levels. Problem: Low GPU usage and low framerates in games that worked fine before (BF 4 and Far Cry 4 went from gt60 FPS to ~30 FPS). FPS is low even on lowest settings. GPU load checked using RTSS and GPU-Z. (40% when playing BF4) Steps taken: Rolled back newest drivers to ones that are a couple months old (416.34), using DDU. Problem still persists. Moved the games to SSD. Didn't help. Checked 3DMark - 99% usage in there. Weird. SPECS: CPU: Intel Core i5-6500 GPU: GIGABYTE ENG Game may load my GPU up to 100% w/o a reason and freeze my PC for 1-2 minutes. The moment by GPUZ — It's 100% caused by game because I tried so many ultra-settings in other games or stress-tests like FurMark I have a 980ti 6gb and I'm running a 1440 ultrawide monitor. In a bit more scenery dense areas my GPU usage will pretty much ride at 95% and spike to 100% which seems to cause stutters. My FPS will drop to ~45-50 in these situations but its far less smooth. VRAM is always in check and never seems to go over about 40-60%. I've lowered some shadow settings, lowered MSAA as well as updated drivers. none of which seem to have any affect on the GPU usage or frames. Is this a common GPU load?.

Wondering what your GPU is doing? Curious how much GPU capability you're using? Do you want to know practically every detail about your GPU? You may want to try the free Windows-exclusive tool from TechPowerUp called GPU-Z. I've been using this tool for a while now to prepare. So, I'm new (about a month) to PC sim racing, in general, after years of console. I've also purchased a Rift and am just absolutely loving it. I'm decent with computers but, admittedly, have little to no experience with GPU capabilities, as most of my experience has been small business/IT related networking and maintenance. Using a PC for entertainment beyond my multimedia server is new to me. My question is, how much am I taxing my GPU, already the weak link in my machine (i7 8700k/GTX970). If you see horizontal or vertical green lines on your screen, it means that you have Show GPU load balancing enabled in the NVIDIA Display control panel.

Крч играю я в мафию 3 заметил такую вещь, что играя в нее у меня загрузка видюхи на 100% наверное именно поэтому и бывает просадка в фпс, как исправить данную. Okay Reddit I'm at a loss by this point, here's what's happening my GPU seems to be acting as if there is some sort of adaptive sync or power management in place. Games like dragon quest 11 would keep it 99% usage constantly, were as now it fluctuates constantly between 60-94%. It seems unable to hit full load apart from in benchmarking software like Super position even then it can drop to 80% for no reason. I use a gysnc 1440p display so it isn't in game vsync that's causing the issue. hey guys.i have Sapphire HD 7870 XT, i5-3470, 4GB Ram, windows 7 32bit, 23inch monitori sometimes when i play far cry 3 for a long time i see the Load of the GPU goes to 160%!! which is weird? isn't. So I just built a new PC, and everything runs well and fine until I play a game with a high GPU load. I'll be playing the game, and every 10-15 minutes or so my computer will completely freeze for 5-10 seconds, and I can hear the fans on the GPU go a bit wild. These are the specs: CPU : AMD Ryzen 5 2600 GPU : ASUS GeForce GTX 1060 (6gb) RAM : Corsair Vengeance LPX 16gb 3200mhz Motherboard : Aorus B450 Elite SSD : Kingston A400 480gb PSU : Corsair VS650 Any suggestions. Just for fun and for science :geek: I thought Id see how my average system would perform with the new Senza Peso Demo on best settings. 
So i was testing my pc with bench-marking tools (prime 95 user benchmark etc. ) and found out that the Power supply(EVGA 650 GQ, 80+ Gold ) makes a buzzing noise only when im using the GPU under load i had the CPU running at 100% for 30mins nothing then i used User-Benchmarking and the part where its tests your gpu to load certain objects it makes different buzzing noise like a low medium high pitch noise This game has been a real resource hog for me, making it hard to multitask (browsing Reddit for instance, or viewing a Youtube video). After I got this new GPU (GTX 650), the game doesn't use more than 30-40% of the GPU's power, which results in tons of FPS drops and sometimes I play most of the match on 35 FPS, any ideas? I used to get constant 60 FPS in my older GPU (gt 8400gs) and my laptop (Intel HD 3000) both of which are much weaker than the current one. I tried setting maximum performance in Nvidia control panel to no avail. specs: Intel core 2 duo e8400 @3.00 I noticed the test with v-sync off was not tested the same as the one with it on. Here is the one with the same resolution but extreme settings. Anyone else experienced higher than usual gpu load in the new story instances (can only talk about the first one as of now)? On i5-6600k and 1070Ti I hit \~85% load which is huge for gw2 for me whereas my CPU sits at max 60% with arc and all stuff running. 
After the hotfix, my gpu load in game is only 35-40% and the game runs at really low fps. My gpu is geforce gt 630 (I know it's ancient EDIT: It was the rma'd gpu, which was fault again. Shouldn't happen, just bad luck. :) amp#x200B; Hey Guys, amp#x200B; I've got a problem since new year, idk what happened. Everytime I open something GPU demanding like a game or GPU benchmark, my PC just restarts like it gets to hot. No bluescreen, no log in windows. amp#x200B; I thought it was the CPU fan, as it got quite hot (\~70°C), bought a new one and it still doesn't work. amp#x200B; The temperatures are okay, I guess.

I've had some issues with the card not fully reaching its potential during load and now it's worse than ever. When I run a benchmark or stand still in a game (PoE) I have 150+ fps and 96%+ load on my gpu. As soon as I begin playing and face content my gpus load goes down amd takes my frames with it.

The tobi-kadachi dual blades are especially harsh for this. This issue has been mentioned on a lot of other gaming discussion sites. I don't know if Capcom is aware of this bug yet. This bug can be reproduced at will by crafting any lightning weapon and testing it on the pillar in the training area https://i.imgur.com/ko7kXNr.jpg. I will do just that.

Recently got my pc a big update, new graphic card 1050Ti and a new fullHD 24" display but unfortunately, even switching resolution and graphic settings, my game is stuck at avarege 30fps. The CPU load is 100% and GPU is doing very small. I can run the game at Fastest and everything off or Super High with everything in max detail, it still is suck at 30fps. Is this just me or, due the fact that Stationeers is still an alpha, it hasn't been optimized. gtx 560 ti 448. inel q9450 @2666-3200 ddr2 4GB 666Mhz В Игрульках проседает фпс, при этом MSI afterburner показывает, что gpu load находится на 20-30%.
